gnomAD Submission Readme
This repository contains code for analyzing and visualizing the frequencies of different chromosomes using data from a VCF (Variant Call Format) file. The primary goal of this project is to generate a plot that displays the frequencies of different chromosomes.

Project Files
freq.py: This Python script contains the code to calculate and sort the frequencies of different chromosomes in descending order.

dummy.vcf: This is a sample VCF file that contains a small dataset of chromosomes for testing and demonstration purposes

python libraries used are --> 1. hail, 2.Matplotlib
The goal of this project is to plot the frequies of different chromomsomes form the given data
(This project is a file submission for prospace project based on gnomAD)
